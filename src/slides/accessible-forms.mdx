# What to look for
## Functionality

---

# Problem 1: We use HTML in a way that's not quite right

TODO: Demo `<a>` element being used to trigger same-page event.
- no href
- `<button type="button">`
- `tabindex="0"`

---

# Problem 2: JavaScript magic

TODO: Demo for inaccessible custom select

Link: WAI-ARIA 1.1 Authoring practices

---

# Problem 3: ARIA magic

TODO: Demo for `<span>` styled like a button. 
- `role="button"`

---

# Suggestions: Functionality

- Use built-in keyboard behavior where possible
- Use HTML instead of roles
- Test all third-party libraries
- Become familiar with common keyboard interactions

---

# What to look for: Focus

---

# Problem 1: Focus rings

TODO: Image of different focus rings
TODO: Image of focus rings against background color
Link: 2.1 non-text requirement

---

# Problem 2: Disappearing focus

TODO: Demo disappearing focus
TODO: Table for hiding things

--- 

# Labels
